    description="While exploring different ways technology can support meaningful causes, I was inspired to build a fundraising platform that empowers users to create their own campaigns and donation pagesâ€”drawing inspiration from platforms like Classy.org. I wanted to make the process simple, customizable, and visually engaging, so users could focus more on their cause and less on technical barriers.
To achieve this, I designed a system where users could choose from a variety of professionally styled templates to quickly launch their own fundraising pages. They could personalize everything from the campaign story to goal trackers and donation tiers. I built the frontend using React.js and Next.js for its component-based flexibility and responsive design capabilities, and used Node.js and Express on the backend to manage user data, campaign logic, and transactions. For data storage, I used MySQL with Azure to track user accounts, campaign progress, and donation records. This project taught me how to build user-focused experiences while managing critical backend services like authentication and authorization."
