    description="I created FulFillAi, a real-time writing assistant that integrates the OpenAI API to provide intelligent autocompletion and contextual research as users type. The goal was to go beyond basic text suggestionsâ€”this tool actively enhances the writing process by generating complex completions and surfacing relevant information mid-sentence, all in real time.
To bring this vision to life, I used React.js and Next.js on the frontend to build a fast, responsive interface with dynamic updates and server-side rendering. The backend was built using Node.js and Express.js, with MySQL as the database to track user sessions, inputs, and research context. The OpenAI integration required careful prompt engineering and stream handling to ensure that completions felt fluid, relevant, and non-intrusive.
This project helped me deepen my understanding of working with streaming APIs, prompt tuning, and state management in complex user flows. I also became more comfortable managing asynchronous data pipelines and designing for responsiveness across the full stack. It was a great experience in combining cutting-edge AI capabilities with scalable web architecture to build a truly interactive user tool."
