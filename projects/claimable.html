    description="I wanted to simplify the frustrating and confusing process of writing insurance denial appeals, especially for people who aren’t familiar with medical or legal jargon. That goal led me to develop a full-stack web application that uses AI to help users generate personalized, high-quality appeal letters. Users can upload their documents, have them automatically parsed, and generate a polished appeal letter using OpenAI—all within a few minutes. To further support users, I also integrated a context-aware chatbot for real-time assistance and clarification.

I built the frontend using React.js, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS to ensure a responsive and intuitive user experience. Users can upload files securely, manage sessions through cookies, and interact with the system seamlessly using Axios to connect with backend APIs. On the backend, I used Node.js and Express, with a MySQL database to handle user data and document metadata. I implemented authentication and authorization using hashed credentials and session-based cookies to ensure data security. For deployment and file storage, I used Azure Web Apps and Azure Blob Storage, allowing the app to scale reliably.

Through this project, I gained experience integrating AI APIs in production, managing secure authentication flows, and deploying scalable cloud-based systems. It was also an opportunity to design for real users—balancing technical complexity with empathy and usability."
